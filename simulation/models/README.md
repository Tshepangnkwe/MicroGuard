## Battery Models

Battery electrochemical and electrical models for simulation.

### TODO: Create/obtain models for

- [ ] Li-ion battery equivalent circuit model
  - Series resistance (ESR)
  - RC networks for polarization
  - Voltage source (OCV vs SoC lookup table)

- [ ] LiPo battery model

- [ ] NiMH battery model

- [ ] Temperature-dependent models

- [ ] Aging/degradation models

### File formats
- SPICE subcircuits (.sub, .lib)
- MATLAB/Octave models (.m)
- Python models (.py)
- Lookup tables (CSV)

### References
- [ ] Research papers on battery modeling
- [ ] Manufacturer datasheets with discharge curves
- [ ] Experimental data for model validation
